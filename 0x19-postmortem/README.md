### Hypothetical Outage: The Day Our Web Stack Went RogueüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The Gist (TL;DR)
What went down: Our web app took a dramatic plunge, leaving 70% of our users stuck in a virtual waiting room.
When it happened: April 5, 2024, from 2:45 PM to 4:05 PM (GMT).
Why it happened: A rogue memory leak from one of our features hogged all the server's resources.

Play-by-Play: A Timeline
2:45 PM: Monitoring alarms went off, warning us about soaring response times.
2:50 PM: Investigation kicked off! Engineers explored database performance and checked network connections.
3:00 PM: The app hit the brakes hard, freezing up on us. Attempts to reboot the server went nowhere.
3:15 PM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps and backend teams for deeper examination.
3:20 PM: All signs pointed to a memory leak as server RAM usage spiked.
3:40 PM: The team tried another server reboot, but the leak kept the party going.
3:50 PM: After further inspection, we zeroed in on a single feature as the memory hog.
4:05 PM: The troublesome feature was disabled, and the app was back on track!
Root Cause and Resolution
The Root Cause: A memory leak in one specific feature was causing the server to run out of steam.
The Resolution: We took the fast track‚Äîdisabling the misbehaving feature‚Äîand got the app back up and running in no time.
Prevention: A Neverending Quest
Tweaks for a Better Future:
Refactor the problematic feature to use memory wisely.
Monitor memory usage per feature more closely.
Action Items:
Tackle the faulty feature and put it on a memory diet.
Enhance memory usage logs for quicker leak detection.
Implement automatic scaling to manage resource demands.
Prioritize rigorous testing of features, focusing on memory management.
Review and optimize the incident response plan, and ensure on-call engineers are well-trained.
