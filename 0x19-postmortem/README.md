Postmortem: Hypothetical Web Stack Outage
Issue Summary
Duration: The outage lasted for approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, starting at 2:45 PM and ending at 4:05 PM on April 5, 2024 (GMT).
Impact: The web application experienced significant performance degradation and eventual downtime. Users encountered slow page loads and intermittent failures, affecting around 70% of users trying to access the platform.
Root Cause: The root cause was a memory leak in the web application server that eventually led to resource exhaustion and unavailability of the service.
Timeline
2:45 PM: Monitoring alerted the on-call engineer of an increase in response times and error rates across the application.
2:50 PM: An engineer confirmed the issue and began investigating potential causes, focusing on database performance and network connectivity.
3:00 PM: The application became unresponsive. Engineers attempted to restart the web server but found it unresponsive as well.
3:15 PM: Engineers escalated the incident to the DevOps and backend teams.
3:20 PM: The teams suspected a potential memory leak due to high memory usage on the server.
3:40 PM: The affected server was restarted, but the issue recurred shortly after.
3:50 PM: The team began isolating components of the application to identify the source of the memory leak.
4:05 PM: The root cause was traced to a specific application feature that was consuming excess memory. The feature was temporarily disabled, and the application resumed normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: A specific feature in the web application had a memory leak due to improper management of resources. This leak led to excessive memory usage, eventually causing the application server to crash and become unresponsive.
Resolution: The problematic feature was disabled to stop the memory leak and stabilize the system. Engineers performed a graceful restart of the affected server, which restored service to users.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Refactor the problematic feature to ensure proper memory management and prevent future leaks.
Enhance monitoring to include detailed tracking of memory usage per feature.
Tasks:
Investigate and fix the memory leak in the problematic feature.
Add more comprehensive logging for memory usage to detect potential leaks early.
Implement automatic scaling to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion.
Conduct thorough testing of new features for memory management issues before deployment.
Review the incident response plan and improve training for on-call engineers.
